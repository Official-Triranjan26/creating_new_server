 what are node packeges?why needed?

in package.json go to scripts and add  -> "dev" : "nodemon server.js"

command to run the server:
previously : npm start (used for deploying perpose)
now	   : npm run dev ("run" because "dev" is not a default scropt) (used for development perpose)

whenever we install a third party package , it will get added to the depedencies in package.json

if we delete the package-log.json and node_modeules we can re install them easily.Just go the terminal and write "npm i"
that's it ,it will install all the packages which are present in dependencies of package.json

package-log.json : it is a mentinence file : it keeps the track of  the depentencies of packages which are getting installed
